Future updates:
1. Detemine if the wait is needed when mating
2. Allow the start to be more randomized for each units FOV, View Distance and Speed
3. Update the mutation so other variables (FOV, View Distance and Speed) can mutate both up and down. 
4. Update the models to look realistic
5. Have the camera automatically move to fit the size of the base plane
