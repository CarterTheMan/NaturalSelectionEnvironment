Future updates:
1. Allow the start to be more randomized for each units FOV, View Distance and Speed
2. Update the mutation so other variables (FOV, View Distance and Speed) can mutate both up and down.
3. Have the camera automatically move to fit the size of the base plane
4. Add rabbbit holes for them to hide in when running from a predator
5. Add a variable to animals to control their desire to hunt vs. mate vs. flee so they they don't all follow the same desire. This will also be something that can mutate up or down. 
6. Update the models to look realistic
